# Backend_flow
In this directory, the SystemVerilog code for the accelerators can be found. 

In this folder can be found:
Directories:
- **OpenLane_logs_and_conf**: In this folder, the log and configuration files for the OpenLane flow  for both the implementation with compression and without compression can be found. 
- **Accelerator_with_compression_real_FM**: In this folder, the OpenRAM macro files can be found for both the 8KB and 1KB SRAM macro.
- **Accelerator_without_compression**: In this folder, the Verilog files generated by SV2V can be found for both the implementation with compression and without compression.
- **Accelerator_without_compression_real_FM**: In this folder, the SV code for non-synthesizable accelerator without compression be can be found.
